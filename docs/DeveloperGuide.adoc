By: `Team W12-2`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"] +
 +
Similarly, we can store a `EnrolledModules` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `EnrolledModules` object per unique `EnrolledModules`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `EnrolledModules` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassEvenBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]


// tag::mergetimetable[]
=== Merge Timetable Feature
==== Current Implementation
The merge feature allows for users to select multiple contacts and outputs a merged timetable with all
their common free slots. When the user inputs the indexes of the contacts he wants to merge, the `Persons` are stored
in an array , `personsToMerge`. The array is then iterated through, merging the all objects inside and
outputting a final `Person` to be added to the address book.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the merge mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user selects the indexes of the contacts he wants to merge. `MergeCommandParser` takes the input and puts
it in a list, it then calls MergeCommand with the list as an argument.

image::MergeCommand1.PNG[width="800"]

Step 2. The Merge Command uses the list of indexes and the `filteredPersonsList` to create and fill the array
`personsToMerge`.

image::MergeCommand2.PNG[width="800"]

Step 3. The `mergeTimetable` function is called on each element in `personsToMerge` and the element after it. The merge
Timetable function iterates through all the time slots in both timetables and compares them.

image::MergeCommand3.PNG[width="800"]

Step 4. Based on whether both original time slots were free or busy, it outputs a merged free or busy time slot and
adds it to the merged timetable

image::MergeCommand4.PNG[width="800"]

Step 5. The last element in the `personsToMerge` array is returned after all the iterations. This new person is added
to the address book.

image::MergeCommand5.PNG[width="800"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the `merge` function works.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How merge executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new person with the merged timetable to add to the address book.
** Pros: Easier to implement for testing the logic of the merge command.
** Cons: Very clunky UI wise to have to find the added person.
Have to manually delete the person after every merge to
to prevent having many merged people in the contacts list.
* **Alternative 2 (To be implemented):** Have a specific Class that has timetable and name that is updated with the
merged timetable and names of people being merged whenever merge command is called and have a specific part of the UI
 for displaying this Class.
** Pros: Better user experience by letting user easily see the merged timetable. Does not need manual deletion of
contacts. Better follows Separation of Concerns Principle.
** Cons: Requires more time to implement.
// end::mergetimetable[]

// tag::deleteNotes[]
=== Notes Manipulation feature
==== Current Implementation

The notes manipulation mechanism is facilitated by `NotesDownloaded`.
It is a part of `ModelManager`, storing the names of the modules of notes
downloaded.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `NotesDownloaded#setNotes(Set<String> notes)` -- Replaces the contents of the notes list with {@code notes}.
* `NotesDownloaded#addNotes(String n)` --  Adds new notes {@code n} to the NotesDownloaded
* `NotesDownloaded#deleteSelectedNotes(Set<String> modulesCodes)` -- Removes {@code moduleCodes} from NotesDownloaded.
* `NotesDownloaded#clear() -- Clears the existing data of this {@code NotesDownloaded}.

The first operation is only used once in the initialization of `ModelManager`.
These last 3 operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addNotes(String, String)`,
 Model#deleteSelectedNotes(String, Set<String>)` and `Model#resetNotesData()` respectively.

Within `NotesDownloaded`, there is an attribute called notes, where the names of the modules are stored.
notes is a TreeSet, which helps to sort the modules stored according to their names, in an lexicographical
order. TreeSet's underlying data structure is a binary tree.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the notes manipulation mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `NotesDownloaded` will be initialized with the
initial notes state, which is empty.

Step 2. The user executes `downloadAllNotes user/e0123456 pass/password1 mod/CS2101` command to download all notes
for the module CS2101.  The `downloadAllNotes` command calls `Model#addNotes(String, String)`.  This in turn calls
 NotesDownloaded#addNotes(String).  Thus, the module code of the newly downloaded notes are  to be saved in notes

 state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the
  `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.

// end::deleteNotes[]

// tag::sortingofpersons[]
=== Sorting of contacts feature
==== Current Implementation

The sorting mechanism is implemented with `UniquePersonListHelper`, which is facilitated by `UniquePersonList`, which keeps a list of unique persons in `AddressBook`.
`UniquePersonListHelper` sorts the contacts in `UniquePersonList` in an alphabetical order, according to the person's name.
It implements the following operations:

* `UniquePersonList#add()` -- Adds a new person to `UniquePersonList`, and hence the contact list
* `UniquePersonList#remove()` -- Removes a new person to `UniquePersonList`, and hence the contact list
* `UniquePersonList#setPerson()` -- Sets a new person, in place of an existing person, to `UniquePersonList`, and hence the contact list
* `UniquePersonList#setPersons()` -- Sets a list of persons, in place of the current list of persons, to `UniquePersonList`, and hence the contact list
* `UniquePersonList#contains()` -- Checks if a person is already a part of `UniquePersonList`, and hence the contact list

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface, through `ModelManager`, then through `AddressBook`.
In `Model`, they are exposed as `Model#addPerson()`, `Model#deletePerson()`, `Model#updatePerson()`,
`Model#resetData()`, and `Model#hasPerson()` respectively.

Within `ModelManager`, the above listed operations are directly exposed as
`ModelManager#addPerson()`, `ModelManager#deletePerson()`, `ModelManager#updatePerson()`,
`ModelManager#resetData()`, and `ModelManager#hasPerson()` respectively.

Within `AddressBook`, the above listed operations are directly exposed as
`AddressBook#addPerson()`, `AddressBook#removePerson()`, `AddressBook#updatePerson()`,
`AddressBook#setPersons()`, and `AddressBook#hasPerson()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sorting mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `UniquePersonListHelper` will be initialized with the saved
persons of the application. For this example, let us assume that the `UniquePersonList` is empty, and hence, there are
no saved persons.

`UniquePersonList` will also be initialized, and will read inputs from `UniquePersonListHelper`.  Since
`UniquePersonListHelper` is empty, `UniquePersonList` will also be empty.

image::SortedListStartingStateListAndTreeDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `add n/David ...` command, which calls `Model#addPerson()`, to add a new person.
The new person will be added to `UniquePersonListHelper`, and `UniquePersonList` will take reference from `UniquePersonListHelper`.

image::SortedListCommand1TreeStateDiagram.png[width="800"]

`UniquePersonListHelper` will always have the correctly sorted persons.  Therefore, it is possible to iterate through
`UniquePersonListHelper` in order to get the sorted order of persons.  This sorted order will be copied into `UniquePersonList`.

image::SortedListCommand1ListStateDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Aaron ...`, , which also calls `Model#addPerson()`, to add a new person. Like step 2, the new person will be added to
`UniquePersonListHelper`, and `UniquePersonList` will take reference from `UniquePersonListHelper`.

Because `UniquePersonListHelper` stores persons in a treemap, with person name as the key, and person as the value in
 the key-value pair of the treemap, it is able to automatically sort persons according to their names.


image::SortedListCommand2TreeStateDiagram.png[width="800"]

When `UniquePersonListHelper` is being iterated through, it will be done so in an in-order depth-first-search, allowing
the output to be the sorted order of persons.  This allows `UniquePersonList` to copy over the sorted order of persons,
from `UniquePersonListHelper`.

image::SortedListCommand2ListStateDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 4. The user executes `add n/Esther ...`, which also calls `Model#addPerson()`, to add a new person. Like step 3, the new person will be added to
`UniquePersonListHelper`, and `UniquePersonList` will take reference from `UniquePersonListHelper`.

Because `UniquePersonListHelper` stores persons in a treemap, Esther will be put behind both Aaron and David.

image::SortedListCommand3TreeStateDiagram.png[width="800"]

Like step 3, when `UniquePersonListHelper` is being iterated through, it will be done so in an in-order depth-first-
search, allowing the output to be the sorted order of persons.  This allows `UniquePersonList` to copy over the sorted
order of persons, from `UniquePersonListHelper`.

image::SortedListCommand3ListStateDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 5. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake.  The user wishes to change Esther's name to Bella.
The user decides to edit the person Esther, by executing the `edit 3 n/Bella...` command.  This calls `Model#updatePerson()` The `edit 3 n/Bella...`
command will check if Esther is a valid person, and will replace the name Esther, with the name Bella.  All other
properties of that person instance will remain the same.

Because alphabetically, B comes before D, person Bella, which was previously Esther, will now come before David.  The
red-black tree underlying data structure of treemap, is able to handle this.

image::SortedListCommand4TreeStateDiagram.png[width="800"]

Like step 4, when `UniquePersonListHelper` is being iterated through, it will be done so in an in-order depth-first-
search, allowing the output to be the sorted order of persons.  This allows `UniquePersonList` to copy over the sorted
order of persons, from `UniquePersonListHelper`.

image::SortedListCommand4ListStateDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user now decides that the person, Bella was a mistake.  Person Bella should not be in the `AddressBook`.
The user wishes to delete the person Bella, by executing the `delete 2` command.  This calls `Model#deletePerson()`.
  The `delete 2` command will check if
Bella is a valid person, and if so, will delete the person Bella.

The red-black tree which is the underlying data structure of treemap, is able to handle this operation.  It simply
replaces the node it is about to delete, with the in-order successor.  More operations will be done to ensure a balanced
tree, within the underlying red-black tree.

image::SortedListCommand5TreeStateDiagram.png[width="800"]

Like step 5, when `UniquePersonListHelper` is being iterated through, it will be done so in an in-order depth-first-
search, allowing the output to be the sorted order of persons.  This allows `UniquePersonList` to copy over the sorted
order of persons, from `UniquePersonListHelper`.

image::SortedListCommand5ListStateDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the Bella does not exist in `UniquePersonListHelper`,`UniquePersonListHelper` will return an error, and the
 `delete` command will not be executed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `UniquePersonList` stays sorted when an `add` command is executed:

image::SortedListSequenceDiagramCommandAdd.png[width="800"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the `UniquePersonList` stays sorted when an `delete` command is executed:
It is very similar to that of the `add` command.

image::SortedListSequenceDiagramCommandDelete.png[width="800"]

Step 7. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as
`list`, will usually not call `Model#addPerson()`, `Model#deletePerson()`, `Model#updatePerson()`, `Model#resetData()`,
or `Model#hasPerson()`.  Thus the state of `UniquePersonListHelper` will remain unchanged.

image::SortedListCommand6TreeStateDiagram.png[width="800"]

Therefore, `UniquePersonList` will also remain unchanged.

image::SortedListCommand6ListStateDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 8. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#resetData()`.  This replaces all data in the address book with an
empty address book.  Hence, `UniquePersonListHelper` will be cleared of all persons.

image::SortedListCommand7TreeStateDiagram.png[width="800"]

Therefore, `UniquePersonList` will also be cleared of all persons.

image::SortedListCommand7ListStateDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the list is sorted

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a helper class, UniquePersonListHelper, which uses a treemap to sort the names.
Clears the UniquePersonList every time a change is made, and iterates through the UniquePersonListHelper, to build a new
 UniquePersonList.
** Pros: Easy to implement.  Allows for minimal and compartmentalised changes throughout the code base.  Fast overall
time complexity of O(N).
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** implement a comparator in the current UniquePersonList.
** Pros: Will use less memory, because there is no need for a helping class or data structure.
** Cons: It has a time complexity of O(N log N), which is slower than our chosen implementation.

===== Aspect: Defensive programming practices for helper class

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement all checks for errors in the helper class, `UniquePersonListHelper` and none in
`UniquePersonList`.  This is because the helper class is in charge of the actual execution of the program.  If the checks for
errors are implemented in `UniquePersonList` only, it is possible for a new developer to accidentally bypass the checks.
** Pros: Prevents unnecessary checks and hence, potentially confusing code.
** Cons: If any changes are made to the helper class in the future, e.g. removing the helper class, the developer has
to remember to implement his/her own checks.
* **Alternative 2:** Implement all checks for errors in both `UniquePersonList` and `UniquePersonListHelper`.
** Pros: This would add an additional layer of defence to possible careless mistakes by developers in the future.  E.g.
If they were to make their own version of the helper class but forget to implement their own checks for errors, `UniquePersonList`
would still have backup checks.
** Cons: This makes code harder to understand, by introducing redundant checks, which would be misleading.  Redundant checks
might also incorrectly encourage careless programing habits.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

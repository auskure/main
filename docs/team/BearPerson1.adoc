== [blue]#Summary of contributions#
* *Major Enhancement* : Added ability to download notes from IVLE automatically.


** What it does: Allows the user to download all notes of a certain module using the `downloadAllNotes` command
as well as view all the available files and select which files to download with the `downloadSelectNotes` command.

** Justification: This feature will streamline notes downloads by simplifying it to 1 to 2 lines of command input.

** Highlights: We employed the Selenium Web-driver library to implement this feature. The libraries uses features that has several conflicts with the existing code base, which required special care to resolve.


** Credits: Selenium WebDriver.


* *Minor Enhancement* :  added the ability to view the notes download using the `showNotes`
//must have the same treatment as the major enchancement

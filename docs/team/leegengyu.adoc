This portfolio documents my contributions to a NUS Software Engineering project.

== PROJECT: NSync

---

== Overview

NSync is a desktop application with a command-line interface that helps NUS students resolve the problem of scheduling meetings (and inefficient notes downloading) between their peers, team mates and friends in a simple and fuss-free manner.

== Summary of contributions

* *Main Feature Implemented*: Feature to *export and import user details*.
** What it does: Allows the user to `export` and `import` all the details of a particular contact. These details include the name, contact number, email, address and time-table of the contact.
** Justification: Each user has to key in all of their contacts' individual details previously, which is a very time-consuming process. This time-saving feature allows the user and his/her contacts to key in their own details in a one-time fashion, before exporting their own details and exchanging it with each other for importing.
** Highlights: This enhancement builds upon all of the existing user details, and requires an in-depth understanding of the workings of the `Logic` and `Model` components. The implementation required coalescing all of a user's details during exporting, as well as decoding it into the respective fields subsequently during importing.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=leegengyu[Functional and test code]]

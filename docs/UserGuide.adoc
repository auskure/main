== Introduction

NSync is a program for NUS students who *strive to keep their lives organised, despite their busy schedules*.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`main 3` : deletes contact whose index number is 3
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Items with `1..`​ after them can be used multiple times, excluding zero times e.g. `[ENROLLED MODULE]1..`
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== General Commands


==== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
* Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
* For privacy reasons, `downloadAllNotes` and `downloadSelectNotes` commands will not be saved to history.  This is because
those commands contain the user's IVLE password.
====


==== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

Address book data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +

other tag will not have any effect on the contact created.

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 em/CS2113T`

Figure 1: Sample time-table

Example 1: `free f/self` +
Running this command will show your next available time slot (from current time). +
With reference to Figure 1 above, if the current day and time is Monday 3:00pm, your next available time-slot shown is Monday 4:00pm till 8:00pm. If the current day and time is Monday 4:34pm, your next available time-slot shown is Monday 4:34pm till 8:00pm.

Example 2: `free f/1 f/7 f/9` +

[NOTE]
Running this command outside the day window of Monday to Friday or time window of 8am to 7pm will return a time slot from the next weekday.

You can find a common free time-slot for up to 20 contacts <to be confirmed>.
// end::freecommand[]

// tag::exportcommand[]
==== Export user data: `export`
Met a new acquaintence who would like to have your contact details and time-table to schedule a common meeting time? `export` allows you to export all of a user's (or your own) details in each respective field into an encoded string. (Once you have sent the string to another NSync user, he/she can use `import` to retrieve the data within the encoded string - see `import` for more details) +
Format: `export PUBLIC/PRIVATE SELF/INDEX`

****
* Type 'public' if you would like the user who imports your contact to see the full contents of your time-table.
* Type 'private' if you would like the user who imports your contact to see only your free and busy time-slots respectively (specific contents of your time-table are hidden!).
****

All examples shown below are with reference to the sample time-table shown in Figure 1 above.

Example 1: `export public self` +
The importing user will see your time-table in its entirety (i.e. the full contents of the time-table), as seen in Figure 2 below.

image::ExportPublicView.png[width="800"]
Figure 2: What the user who imports will see (public view)

Example 2: `export private self` +
The importing user will see only the free and busy time-slots in your time-table, as seen in Figure 3 below.

image::ExportPrivateView.png[width="800"]
Figure 3: What the user who imports will see (private view)

[TIP]
The generated string from the command will be automatically copied for you (no manual selecting and copying required)! All you have to do is to send it in its entirety to a fellow user who will import it.

[NOTE]
Exporting more than 1 user's details at a time is currently not available (but will be implemented in future releases!)
// end::exportcommand[]

// tag::importcommand[]
==== Import user data: `import`

Did you receive an encoded string from a NSync contact? Use `import` to transfer all of the data within the string into your copy of NSync! +
Format: `import ENCODED_STRING`

Example 1: `import VALID_ENCODED_STRING` +
If you have imported a valid string, all of the imported user's details will now be found in your NSync.

[NOTE]
If the time-table that is imported shows only black and white colored entries, it means that the exporting user has chosen the `private` option during the `export` process. See `export` for more details.

[TIP]
Importing a contact with the same name as another contact in your NSync will result in the imported data over-writing all of the existing details of the contact!

Example 2: `import INVALID_ENCODED_STRING` +
If you have missed out a character, or accidentally modified one of the characters in the string, attempting to import the invalid string will result in an error displayed. Please obtain a valid string from the contact who passed it to you.
